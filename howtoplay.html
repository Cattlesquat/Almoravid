<p style="font-size:18px;">
This new Almoravid module was created by <strong>Brian 
Reynolds</strong>. 
    
<br> <br> Special thanks to <strong>Game Designer Volko Ruhnke</strong> who
answered numerous esoteric rules questions during development and invited me
to his house for a hands-on Levy & Campaign learning session; <strong>Stephen Stone</strong> who 
created the beautiful "wooden pieces" and drop shadows; <strong>John Campbell</strong> who gave much useful feedback
on early versions of the module during development; <strong>Wendell Albright</strong> who provided several important
suggestions at the beginning; and <strong>Mark Simonitch</strong> from GMT who helped with locating all of the art.

<br> <br>The module is presently maintained by <strong>Brian 
Reynolds</strong> - please report any problems to 
<strong>brian@brianreynolds.net</strong>. 
                                                       
 <br> <br>
    <h2 style="font-size:26px">First Things First</h2><p style="font-size:18px;">
Under the "Help" menu you will find a link to the latest version of the Almoravid rulebook, in case you are 
still learning how to play the game itself, or just need to "look up a rule". 
                                                          <br><br>
The Almoravid module was developed alongside version 3.6 of VASSAL itself--for example
support for easily moving/dragging/sending Lord Mats along with all the pieces <i>on</i> 
the mats was added to VASSAL in order to support the Levy & Campaign series. The module
therefore uses a quite different interface paradigm from Nevsky (and perhaps other VASSAL
modules you've used), so please take a few moments to get familiar with 
it -- although different, it is designed to be very intuitive and easy-to-use, 
and to replicate as closely as possible "the over-the-board experience". We hope you enjoy 
it!

                    <h3 style="font-size:22px">2. Cards and Setup</h3>
          <p style="font-size:18px;"> Before the game begins, the event cards 
              for 1917 and 1918 wait in separate stacks. Click the 
              <strong>"Start Game"</strong> button below them, and they will be 
              automatically shuffled 
              together into four campaign decks, which will be placed in a 
              single draw pile. At this time the randomized part of the game 
              board setup for a Senate Cell and a Moderates cell will be 
              performed.

              <br><br>
              When ready to begin play, click the <strong>"Click to Draw First
              Card"</strong> button, which will deal the first event as well as 
              an upcoming event. 

              <br><br> <br><img src="AdvanceTurn.png">
              <h3 style="font-size:22px">3. Advancing the Turn</h3> 
              <p style="font-size:18px;">
                  Clicking the <strong>"Click to Draw Next Event Card</strong> 
                  button will handle tasks associated with advancing the turn:
                  <ul style="font-size:18px;">
                      <li>Previous event or propaganda card is discarded.</li>
                      <li>Assuming the discarded card was not a propaganda 
                          card, Eligibility tokens will be updated.</li>
                      <li>Upcoming event becomes current event.</li>
                      <li>New Upcoming Event drawn. If it is a propaganda 
                          card, it is swapped with the Curent Event.</li>
                      <li>If new event has "German Action" marked, then 
                          German Eligibility marker will be positioned to remind
                          players to roll for its position.</li>
                  </ul> 
                  <p style="font-size:18px;">NOTE: though a card can also be manually dragged -- e.g. from 
                  the Event Deck to the Upcoming slot, or from the Current Event 
                  slot to the discard area. Doing any one of these steps 
                  manually will likewise set in motion the entire chain of 
                  events listed above.

                     <h3 style="font-size:22px">3. Units and Markers</h3>
            <p style="font-size:18px;">The wooden pieces are separated into a 
                different layer from the cardboard counters, to prevent 
                accidental movement and stacking. The complete drawing order 
                from bottom to top is Map, Buttons/Labels, Cards, Counters, 
                Pieces. <br><br>

                Whenever either pieces or counters need to be "flipped", this 
                can be consistently accomplished with <strong>Ctrl+F</strong> 
                (or by right-clicking the piece or counter and selecting the 
                appropriate menu option). Similarly, pieces can be returned to 
                their various force pools and reserves with 
                <strong>Ctrl+E</strong>.

              <h3 style="font-size:22px">4. Control, Support, and 
                  Opposition</h3> 
              <p style="font-size:18px;">
                <strong>Control</strong> of provinces and towns is automatically 
                calculated based on the presence of Senate, Reds, and Moderates 
                pieces in the space, per 1.7, and does not need to be manually 
                adjusted by players.

                  <br><br><strong>Support</strong> and 
                  <strong>Opposition</strong> can be adjusted either by 
                  right-clicking the appropriate region's display area and 
                  selecting from the menu, or simply selecting the area and 
                  using one of the hotkeys -- either the <strong>+</strong> and 
                  <strong>-</strong> keys on the keypad or 
                  <strong>Ctrl+1</strong> through <strong>Ctrl+5</strong> to go 
                  directly to a specific level.

              <p style="font-size:18px;">
      This module has a special "Plop-a-Piece" feature to make adding pieces to 
      the board super easy -- you can <strong>right-click <i>anywhere</i> in a 
      Province or Town</strong>, and select the piece you want directly from the 
      menu. The piece will 
      be retrieved from the appropriate force pool or reserve and placed exactly 
      where you clicked.
                  <br><br>
                  You can also, of course, choose to manually drag pieces to and 
                  from their reserve and force pool locations.

                      Pieces</h3> 
              <p style="font-size:18px;">
      Pieces can be returned to their Available Forces pools by right-clicking 
      on them and selecting <strong>Return to Available</strong> from the menu; 
      they can also of course be dragged their by hand.
                  <br><br>Should any of the force pools become "untidy", they 
                  can be rearranged by selecting the <strong>Rearrange Available
                  Forces</strong> option on any piece in the pool.

              <p style="font-size:18px;">
      Pawns to mark spaces selected by commands can also be placed by "plopping 
      them" (simply right click anywhere in a town or province and select the 
      appropriate colored Pawn from the menu).
                  <br><br>
      Pawns can be cleared by clicking the "Remove all Pawns" button on the 
      toolbar. They can also be individually deleted, and will be automatically 
      cleared whenever a new event card is drawn.

                  <h3 style="font-size:22px">8. Troops</h3> 
              <p style="font-size:18px;">
Troops in the <strong>German Forces</strong> and <strong>Russian Forces</strong> 
boxes can be toggled between "Available" and "Out of Play" with the 
<strong>Ctrl+F</strong> hotkey or their menus. 

<br><br><strong>Vassalage</strong> levels are displayed in the upper right of 
each Forces box, and can be adjusted with the + and - buttons -- they can also 
be adjusted by moving the Vassalage markers on along the edge track. 

<br><br>During the <strong>Reset Phase</strong> of a Propaganda Card, when the 
"Click For Propaganda Reset" button is clicked, troops in the force pool will 
have their Available / Out of Play status adjusted automatically.

                      Markers</h3> 
              <p style="font-size:18px;">
The markers for Cells on Map, Senate Town Pop, Oppose+Admins, and 
Networks+Issues+1 will all move automatically as pieces are moved about the map. 
Players do not need to adjust these markers manually.

<br><br> <br><img src="HelpResources.png">                
                  <h3 style="font-size:22px">10. Resources</h3> 
              <p style="font-size:18px;">
Resource levels can be adjusted with the <strong>+</strong> and 
<strong>-</strong> buttons provided in each force pool area. They can also be 
changed by moving the resource cylinders along the edge track.
                  <br><br>
When the <strong>Prop Card</strong> marker is moved into the Resources box on 
the Propaganda track (along the right side of the board), the <strong>Resource
Income</strong> for each faction will be displayed in the chat log. Clicking the 
"Apply Resource Income" button, which will appear nearby at that time, will add 
the appropriate number of resources to each faction.

                  <h3 style="font-size:22px">11. German Eligibility</h3> 
              <p style="font-size:18px;">
When an event card marked with <strong>German Action</strong> becomes the 
current event, the German Eligibility cylinder will be moved to the top of the 
Eligibility display, next to a <strong>Roll German Eligibility</strong> button. 
Clicking this button will make the German Eligibility roll (displayed in the 
chat log) and position the eligibility marker. 
                  <br><br>The <strong>Coordinate</strong> marker can be dragged 
                  on top of the German Eligibility marker to show the Senate 
                  player has taken the Coordinate action (There is also a 
                  right-click menu option to add it). It will remain until the 
                  next time the eligibility marker cycles out of play.

              <p style="font-size:18px;">
The faction eligibility markers should be placed in the Sequence of Play area as 
each faction selects Command, Limited Command, Event, and Pass options (see 
section 2.2 of the rulebook). 
                  <br><br>When the next event card is dealt, faction eligibility 
                  markers will be adjusted <i>automatically</i> to show the next 
                  turn's eligibility order.

              <p style="font-size:18px;">
                  Right-clicking anywhere in the Political Display will allow 
                  political cubes to be added. They can also be manually placed 
                  from the Senate and Reds available forces areas. 
                  <br><br>When a Propaganda card appears and play reaches the 
                  Politics Phase (see 6.2), make a die roll as appropriate using 
                  one of the dice buttons on the toolbar. Then select any of the 
                  three issues at the right of the political display: 
                  right-click to bring up the menu, and select the way in which 
                  the issue is to be resolved. One can then right click on the 
                  main political display to return all political cubes to their 
                  available forces areas.

                  <h3 style="font-size:22px">14. Propaganda Cards</h3> 
              <p style="font-size:18px;">
                  When a Propaganda card becomes the current event, the 
                  <strong>Prop Card</strong> counter should be moved, space by 
                  space, down the track on the right side of the map as players 
                  conduct a <strong>Propaganda Phase</strong>. As the counter is 
                  moved from space to space, the module will provide 
                  instructions and information in the chat log that will assist 
                  in carrying out the Propaganda Phase accurately. 
<br><br>
                  At the conclusion of the Propaganda Phase (assuming there is 
                  no immediate winner and the game continues), click the "Click 
                  at End of Propaganda" button to complete the phase. After 
                  this, the next Event card can be drawn as usual.


<br><br><br><img src="HelpPivotal.png"><br>
                  <h3 style="font-size:22px">15. Pivotal Event</h3> 
              <p style="font-size:18px;">
                  The <strong>Red Revolt</strong> pivotal event card begins the
                  game to the right of the Upcoming Event pile. When conditions 
                  are reached (see 2.4) for the Pivotal Event to become active, 
                  it can be manually activated by right-clicking the card and 
                  selecting the appropriate option. It can likewise be activated 
                  by simply dragging it to the Upcoming Event pile. 
                  <br><br>
                  If it has not been activated by the time the second Propaganda 
                  phase is complete, the Pivotal Event will automatically be 
                  activated.


<br><br><br><img src="HelpVictory.png"><br>
                  <h3 style="font-size:22px">16. Victory Checks</h3> 
              <p style="font-size:18px;">
              Whenever the <strong>Prop Card</strong> marker is moved to the 
              "Victory" space on the Propaganda Track, a victory check (7.2) 
              will be performed automatically and the results displayed in the 
              chat log. Likewise, at the end of the Fourth Propaganda phase, a 
              Final Victory (7.3) will be performed, including any appropriate 
              tie breakers being applied.
                  <br>
                  Note: the module does not impose any requirement for the 
                  players to stop playing if a Victory Check is passed, it 
                  simply provides the information -- thus the current victory 
                  status can easily be "checked" at any time simply by moving 
                  the <strong>Prop Card</strong> marker to the Victory space.

    units can be cleared with the adjacent button. 

    <br><br><h3 style="font-size:22px">18. LookAt "Flare" feature</h3><p style="font-size:18px;">Ctrl+Clicking on any part of the map will

    both server and logfile/PBEM play.
